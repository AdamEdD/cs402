Write a program that can fetch this realtime xml feed for your chosen bus stop id,
parses it and displays the bus times in a more readable tabular form..

example BE stopid: "131841" (Virginia -> Cavan)
example BAC stopid: "1234"

The program takes voice input and returns the bus information through a voice interface, similar to that as a service provided by Apples Siri or Amazons Alexa
